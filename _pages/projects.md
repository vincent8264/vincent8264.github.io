## Research Projects

### Digital Twin Optimization for Nuclear Accident Mitigation
- <small>Developed a Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA) to optimize control parameters in digital twin simulations of nuclear power plant accident scenarios.</small>
- <small>Applied the method to medium break loss of coolant accidents (MBLOCAs) at the Maanshan nuclear power plant as an alternative to genetic algorithms.</small>
- <small>Optimized system decreased core damage frequency (CDF) from 2.92x10⁻⁷ to 3.03x10⁻⁸</small>

### Plasma Characteristics Prediction

- <small>Implemented machine learning models to predict electron temperature and electron density from helium spectral line ratios.</small>
- <small>Compared SVM, XGBoost, and deep neural networks, achieving improved electron temperature prediction accuracy (R² increased from 0.93 to 0.96 using XGBoost).</small>
- <small>Demonstrated that DNNs outperform traditional models for electron density prediction, while SVM and XGBoost are more effective for temperature estimation.</small>
